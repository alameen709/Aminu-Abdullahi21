        <p><h6>HISTORY OF GWANDU TOWN</h6></p>
        <p> <p>The name "Gwandu" derives from the
    Hausa word gandu, which translate to "royal farmland." The town's origins
    can be traced back to its earlier days as a small village under the leadership of the royal farmer of Kanta
    Kotal, who was the first King of Kebbi who reigned from 1517 to 1561. Over time, the villaged developed and
    expanded, eventually becoming a town.</p>Gwandu is the second most important city in the history of Islam in the 19th Century West Africa. Abdullahi
          bin Fodiyo, the younger brother to Shehu Usmanu was, before the conquest of Birnin Kebbi from the Kabawa, the
          Grand Wazir (Prime Minister) of the Caliphate. After 1809, the Caliphate was divided into two major parts for
          administrative expediency. The western part, from Gwandu to Ilorin, was under the control of Abdullahi and the
          Eastern part, from Sokoto to Adamawa under the control of Muhammad Bello.</p>
        <p>Since then, the Emirate of Gwandu and its subsequent Emirs, continue to contribute in the realization and
          sustenance of the ideals and legacies upon which, the egalitarian Caliphate of Sokoto was founded.
          Therefore, the appropriate positioning of the history of this great, historic, as well as political and
          spiritual centre (Gwandu Emirate) in the annals of Nigerian history is indispensable. Thus, our discussion
          begins with the overview of some reasons responsible for the jihad in Hausa land including the Kebbi Kingdom
          in the late 18th century, which necessitated the reform movement led by the Shehu and his brother Abdullahi,
          with the support of their son Muhammad Bello and companion and helper Aliyu Jedo.</p>
          <p>THE JIHAD AND THE EMERGENCE OF THE SOKOTO CALIPHATE </p>
    i. The appalling condition of the common person, the level of injustice in the palaces and judicial homes, the
    alarming moral decadence and mass oppression and suppression of the highest order, the corruption of the religion
    and its accommodation among the ulama' had reached an intolerable proportion in the late 18th century Hausaland.
    Shehu Usman Danfodiyo, his brother Abdullahi Fodiyo, Muhammad Bello and other supporters of the reform movement
    provided the basis for the societal rebirth.
    <p>At the age of twenty (20), in 1774, Shehu started preaching and teaching in a wide scale in Gobir, Kebbi, and
      Zamfara Kingdoms. Since then, Shehu started enjoying the support and encouragement of Abdullahi, his younger
      brother, who was a student under him. These preaching tours provided many opportunities for the Shehu to address
      most of the social ills in the society as well addressing the injustices in the land. Within a short period, his
      teaching became very appealing to the populace in Hausaland, especially the under privileged ones.</p>
    <p>According to Ibrahim Sulaiman (1986) tells us that, Shehu’s perception and character were modified because of his
      in-depth study of the religion, the fountain of knowledge, which he drank as made available by the itinerant
      scholars who preceded him in the western Sudan’. He was conscious that the first responsibility of a scholar was
      to acquaint himself with all required knowledge for the betterment of the society and to guide the people to the
      right path.</p>
    <p> Primarily, to stand up in defence society's values and preservation of its moral standards, to stand up against
      injustice and for the poor and oppressed; and establish society of men and women faithful and submissive to the
      wills of Allah.Under this premise, our argument of why the jihad took place at the time it happened could be
      understood. The compelling situation in which needed a serious attention was multifarious in nature and affected
      all facets of human endeavor. It seriously affected religion, polity, economy, as well as the social and cultural
      fabric of the society. There was the need for an overhaul in order to have a responsible society with a good
      political leadership that would be considerate of human welfare.</p>
      <p> Moral Decadence: The pre-jihad Hausa society was characterized by social ills and moral decadence. The
        prevailing nudity and disrespect for women who veiled themselves were of serious concern to the
        Jihadists-reformers. As indicated in Kitab Nur al -Bab, most of the cultural practices in Hausa society were not
        in conformity with the shari'a'. Thus, the society needed to be transformed and refashioned in accordance with the
        dictates of Islam.</p>
      <p> Alcoholism and indiscriminate intermingle between men and women in markets, streets, and social gatherings were
        the main social imbalances addressed by the Shehu. A practice, which Shehu called Jandudu became widespread
        particularly among the slave girls of Hausa aristocrats and from among the free born. This was in form of exposure
        of nakedness and committing of fornication and adultery (Kitab alFarq). They (men and women) assembled at a place
        with evil intention. He who sees them (at that stage) has seen senselessness (by itself).Men and women lying down
        (half-naked) in the open; each of them with shameless dazzling eyes bulging out. Men and women thou keep on
        clapping their hands jumping up and down turning aside ways staggering.</p>
      <p>In the efforts of Shehu and his supporters to transform the society, they came into an open conflict with
        different segment of the society. The rulers viewed their action with suspicion for its political implication. The
        ulama also perceived the trend of the movement threatening their status and influence in the society. It is
        unnatural for such persons with ideas for reform like that of the Shehu and supporters, in any society to remain
        unmolested and their followers undisturbed by the forces, which derived their influence and control through
        oppression and injustice. The forces of Gobir thus, were mobilized to deal with the followers of Shehu,
        confiscating their properties and families especially when joining him for a Hijrah (migration) from Degel to
        Gudu. In Tazyin al-Waraqat Abdullahi presents:</p>
  
      <p>"So we fled from their land in the year 1218 on the 10 of Dzul- Qa'da to a place outside Gobir territory. The
        Muslims all fled following us. Many of them joined us with their families and property: some brought nothing but
        their people: some came with no following at all. The sultan of Gobir ordered his chiefs to seize the goods of all
        who fled or prevent them leaving. They seized much property of the Muslims, and killed some of them. Then he
        ordered those of the chiefs nearest to us on the east to keep on killing our people, and plundering, and
        imprisoning. The people suffered sorely we went to Shaikh and said truly, this matter has become intolerable;
        recourse had to be made to arms. There can be no doubt that the situation demands a prince to manage our affairs,
        for Muslims should not be without order or Government. Then we did homage to the Shaikh, as is directed by the
        Quran and Sunnah in such circumstances, and made him the leader of the jihad. We rose to ward off attack.
        Self-defense and defense of dependents and possessions is a righteous acct, according to received opinion."</p>
      <p>The jihad was thus, declared, and within four years (i.e. 1804-1808) the entire Hausa states were brought under
        the control of the Jihadists, centrally governed through a Caliphate that emerged thereafter, with the strict
        adherence to the tenets of the Shariah.It is important at this juncture, to give reference briefly to some
        construal about the Jihad movement. Some mischievously presented the Jihad as racial or tribal uprising, to
        others, it was simply aimed at displacing the Hausa ruling class and establishing an empire for the Fulani to
        rule, at the same time some scholars view the movement as an egalitarian reform with focus on the betterment of
        the society in terms of religious and worldly affairs.</p>
      <p>The former opinions were mostly the views of the European colonialists and their cohorts. For them, such
        interpretations, as Fulani against the Hausa would justify their heinous occupation and illegitimate forced
        leadership through colonialism and imperialism in the areas of the Caliphate. In all historical records, with no
        exeption, tribes and ethinc composition of Shehu's Jama'a were drawn from all the peoples of Hausaland and beyond.
        The Fulani, Hausa, Touregs, Nupe, Yoruba, Kanuri and many others supported the Jihad movement and participated
        actively for the establishment of the Sokoto Caliphate. Therefore, there was no way the jihad could be
        attributable to a single tribe, ethnic, or region. Shaikh Abdullah Fodiyo writes in his book Tazyin al-waraqat
        buttressing this opinion, in the following:</p>
      <p>We are an army victorious in Islam,</p>
      <p>And we are proud of nothing but that, (emphasis added)</p>
      <p>Tribes of Islam-and Turubbi is our clan,</p>
      <p>Our Fulani and our Hausa all united,</p>
      <p>And among us other than these, certain tribes joined together.</p>
      <p>For the help of God's religion-made up the union (that established the Caliphate).</p>
 
      <p><h6>SOME OF THE MAJOR STRIKING PROBLEMS THAT NECESSITATED THE JIHAD INCLUDED:</h6></p>
    <p> Corruption of Religion: The practice of the religion of Islam in Hausaland before the jihad was reduced to
      mere syncretism and superstitions. Bori- spirit divination and sacrifices to objects like trees and mountains
      became common practices among the Muslims who only professed the religion verbally but upheld paganism. The aim of
      the Jihadists in this sector was to purify Islam to Sunni practices based on the teaching and practices of the
      holy prophet and his companions (Hiskett, 1984).</p>
    <p>The ulama’ the supposedly vanguard of the religion turned to justifying the corrupt practices of the rulers and
      legalizing evils in the name of religious guidance. This class of people was condemned by the Shehu as (Ulama'
      al-su'-) venal ulama’. He described them in his book wathiqat al-Ikhwan as more dangerous to Muslim community than
      the devil; and their position in the society was no better than a rock in the sea, which can neither drink water
      nor allows others to drink”. That was one of the reasons, which made Shehu to bluntly aim at reforming Islam to
      its pristine position. The major works of Shehu, which includes, Ihya al-Sunnah, Nur al- Bab and Bayan bid'a
      al-shaitaniya were directed to purifying the religious practices of Hausaland.</p>
      <p>THE EMERGENCE OF GWANDU EMIRATE</p>

        It was after this success by the Jihad forces led by Abdullahi in subduing the Kebbi leadership that Gwandu town
        became the center from which the Shehu continued to coordinate the affairs of the movement. Before then, the
        Jihadists did not have a permanent base for them since the outbreak of the Jihad in June 1804. According to Gwandu
        (nd), ‘Gwandu town derives its name from a Hausa word Gandu, meaning a royal farm. These lands originally belonged
        to Kanta, the king of Kebbi, whose head farmer established the
        village, which gradually grew into big settlement and came to be called Gwandu. Later Fulani nomads came and settled
        there as they found the area very rich with pastureland…. Situated in the valley with ridges surrounding it in all
        but the southerly direction, where it is protected by marshy areas, Gwandu enjoyed an excellent natural defense.
        Thus, the Jihadists made it their first administrative Headquarters for running the activities of the reform
        movement in Hausaland in October 1805.
    
        <p>The Shehu’s migration and settlement in Gwandu in the late 1805, was with a view to solving the acute problem of
        military strategy and scarcity of food, pasture and water that his followers were facing at that time. Thus, the
        community moved from Gudu to Magbshi, Tsuntsuwa, Sabon Gari before finally settling in Gwandu. Thus, Gwandu became
        the first permanent seat of the Caliphate four years before Sokoto, which was founded in 1809. It was also from
        Gwandu, between 1805 and 1809 that the young Islamic State led by Amir al-Muminin Shaikh Usman conducted its
        affairs, which included relations with other Jihad leaders in Hausaland, and the sending of military expeditions to
        the area west of Gwandu. For instrance, it was from Gwandu that Shakh Usman sent one of his supporters, Umar Dallaji
        to request Muslim leaders of Katsina, Kano, Daura, and Zamfara to meet him at Magami. The meeting took place at
        Birnin Gada in Zamfara, and Muhammad Bello represented Shehu. The activities conducted by Shehu from Gwandu had the
        effect of extending the jihad and the jurisdiction of the Caliphate. Gwandu was the city from where the
        administration of the western flank of the Caliphate, from Bodinga to Ilorin under the leadership of Abdullahi bin
        Fodiyo from 1817 was administered.</p>
        <p> Political Tyranny: A close study of Shehus Kitab al-Farq will suffice our brief reference on this matter. In
          the book, Shehu Usmanu Danfodiyo posed about thirty charges against the Hausa rulers, which included the Kebbi
          kingdom. Among them, was excessive corruption among the people in authority, illegal possession of peoples
          properties and belongings, misappropriation of public treasury, over taxation unauthorized by the Shari’a,
          confiscation of estates of deceased against the will of inheritors, excessive luxurious living style in the
          palaces and neglect of the welfare of commoners, etc. </p>
        <p>The Shehu's concern on these issues could be seen in his request at Magami to Sarkin Gobir Bawa. He requested
          among other things, (instead of gifts of gold, which his fellow scholars collected) that: "all political prisoners
          should be set free, people should not be over burdened with taxes above their capacity”. His brother Abdullahi
          described the situation as a triumph for the Jama'a who returned -'with authority to establish the religion, while
          others returned with gifts'.</p>
        <p>After the death of Sarkin Gobir Bawa, who granted the request, his successor Yunfa withdrew all and sanctioned
          that, ‘only Shehu was allowed to call people to the religion(i.e. preaching) and no more conversion to Islam by
          those already not within its fold’. This measure was further followed by threats and attacks against the Jama'a
          i.e followers of the Shehu. The atmosphere was tense and the condition unbearable.</p>     
          <p>SOME ASPECTS OF COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION IN GWANDU
            EMIRATE</p>
        
            Europe in the 19th century witnessed a serious transformation and changes in all facets of human endeavour. Because
            of industrial revolution, there were a huge achievement and improvement in terms of communication. Technological
            inventions such as steam engines, powered a number of European sailors to explore other regions of the world,
            especially Africa and Asia. A spectacular concern and interest were on areas and regions with an established polity
            and system of governance that provided their own people a sense of unity, development, and cooperation. The Sokoto
            Caliphate was since then identified as the most advanced polity in Africa south of the Sahara. Therefore, only seven
            years after the death of Shehu Usmanu Danfodiyo, during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Bello, a British envoy was sent
            by the King of England to come and secure bilateral and diplomatic understanding with the Sokoto Caliphate, and sign
            some commercial agreements where possible.
        
            <p>Hugh Clapperton was sponsored to meet Sultan Muhammad Bello in the year 1824, with usual customary ambassadorial
            presents and gifts from the British to the Muslim government of Sokoto. Within the provision of the Shari’ah in
            granting such terms to Christians instantly Sultan Muhammad Bello concentrated and agreed to partner with British in
            commerce, scientific and technical cooperation. Dr Henrich Barth a German, but British sponsored explorer followed
            after Clapperton and secured treaties with Sultan Aliyu Babba son Sultan Muhammad Bello in 1850s. That was the first
            contact the Caliphate had with the Europeans.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-5">
        <p>Subsequently, different European teams of traders, missionaries, and proconsuls continued to visit the territories
        of the Caliphate for different and multifarious reasons. The areas under the jurisdiction of Gwandu Emirate i.e.,
        the western part of the Sokoto Caliphate, such as Ilorin, Nupe, Lapai, Agaie, Songa, Lafiyagi and others were the
        first to come into direct contact with the activities of those colonial vanguards.</p>
    
        <p>As explained earlier, Europeans presented themselves as traders who were only interested in securing and signing
        agreements and treaties with the Gwandu Emirate without exposing any imperial motive. The European companies and
        later their mother countries used these commercial treaties signed between the two parties as evidence of rights to
        occupy the land and have the sole control and monopoly of its resources. In some cases, the Europeans forged
        treaties in order to justify their claim of occupation. For instance, Joseph Thompson in 1886 claimed to have
        obtained treaty from Sokoto and Gwandu, which shows that:</p>
    
        <p>Sokoto and Gwandu are said to have transferred to N.A.C.( National African Company,(later United Africa Company, UAC
        and Royal Niger Company, RNC) their entire rights to the country on both sides
        of the rivers Benue and Kwarra(Niger) for a distance of ten hours journey inland or such distance as they desire
        from each bank of both rivers throughout their domains. In addition, the NAC or its successors were to have sole
        right among foreigners to trade and to mine minerals, while Sokoto and Gwandu were to have
        communication with other foreigners only through them.</p>
    
        i. However, what the Emir of Gwandu and the Caliph in Sokoto conceded to the European traders, which was also
        followed by other emirates under their jurisdiction was nothing but commercial agreements strictly within the
        provision of the Shari’ah. An extract from the document given by those Muslim leaders clearly stated their position.
        It stipulates that, ‘traders from England shall travel under safe conduct throughout the territories of the Amir
        al-Muminin, Ali(i.e. Caliph Aliyu Babba son of Muhammad Bello) with their children, their property and their mounts
        and they shall lose nothing- not even a tether-as they come and go at their good pleasure. Neither in speech shall
        they hear that, which maybe loathsome to them nor shall any oppressor harm them… They shall traffic in everything
        except slaves for the Amir al-Muminin will not allow them to purchase slaves.
    
        <p>According to P. K. Tibenderana:</p>
    
        It was largely on the basis of the treaties and several others, allegedly secured from the Caliph and the Emir of
        Gwandu by the agents of Royal Niger Company during the late 1880s and early 1890s, that Great Britain came to lay
        claim to the territories of the Sokoto Caliphate against the interest of both France and Germany during the European
        partition of Africa.
    
        Consequently, when those emirs realised the implications of the treaties and presence of the Europeans in their
        respective emirates resisted and reported to the emir of Gwandu for intervention. Ilorin and Nupe emirates opposed
        the presence of British garrisons in their domains. Lokoja was made the first Colonial headquarters by the British
        in the upper Niger as early as the late 1899, later Wushishi, and Zungeru in the late 1900.
    
        <p>Such interventions requested by the southern emirates, brought the central Caliphal administration into direct
        conflict with the Europeans. In one of such responses to the activities of the RNC the Caliph sent a letter which
        reads:</p>
    
        <h6>From us to you. I do not concern that any one from you should ever dwell with us. I will never agree with you.
        Between you and us there are no dealings except as between Muslims and unbelievers (kafiri’s),
        War, as God Almighty has enjoined on us. There is no power or strength saves in God on high.</h6>
    
    
        <p>The British High Commissioner, Lord Lugard who took over the charge and control of the areas of the Gwandu Emirate
        from the Royal Niger Company in 1899 considered this statement as open declaration and invitation to war. Tactfully,
        in order to prepare for the military takeover of the Caliphate, the West African Frontier Force headquarters was
        established in Jebba, with detachment in Illo, Ashigiri, Bussa, and Yelwa all under the control of Gwandu Emirate.
        On 1st January 1900, Lord Lugrad hoisted British flag in Lokoja, thereby declaring the area, and indeed most
        territories of the Caliphate as the British protectorate. An Arabic translation of the proclamation was sent to
        Sultan of Sokoto and the Emir of Gwandu.</p>
    
        <p>After receiving the letter, Caliph Abdulrahman exclaimed that, ‘No letter ever brought fear like this one. I’ll read
        no more letters from white men.’ According to Adeleye, Sokoto and Gwandu’s reaction to the proclamation confirmed
        their implacable hostility to the new administration and its pretensions. Kiari, Lugards messenger to Sokoto, was
        told on arrival to bring no more white man’s letters. He was hastily conducted
        out of the town with an assurance, popularly echoed in Sokoto, that they would have nothing to do with the white
        man. Babando, the messenger to Gwandu, was told that there could be no reply after white man had seized Gwandu’s
        territories.</p>
    
        The maxim guns were used to clear away any emir who followed the orders of Gwandu and Sokoto and refused to
        compromise with the Europeans. Therefore, the forceful British occupation started one emirate after another. Within
        a few years, all emirates were subdued and brought under the control of the British from Ilorin up to Gwandu, from
        Adamawa, Gombe, Bauchi to Kano and finally in Sokoto in March 1903. That brought an end to the power of the
        Caliphate and the beginning of British colonial control of all the territories of the Sokoto Caliphate.
        In his proclamation, celebrating the defeat of the Caliphate on 21 March 1903, Lugard says: -
        <p>… Now these are the words, which I, the High Commissioner, have
          to say for the future. The Fulani in old times under Danfodiyo
          conquered this country. They took the right to rule over it, to levy
          taxes, to depose kings and to create kings. They in turn, have by
          defeat, lost their rule, which has come into the hands of the British.
          All these things, which I have said, the Fulani by conquest took the
          right to do now pass to the British. Every Sultan and Emir and the
          principal officers of State will be appointed by the High
          Commissioner, throughout all this country. The High Commissioner
          will be guided by the usual laws of succession and the wishes of the
          people and chiefs, but will set them aside if he desires for good cause
          to do so. The emirs and chiefs who are appointed will rule over the
          people as of old times and take such taxes as are approved by the
          High Commissioner, but they will obey the laws of the Governor and
          will act in accordance with the advice of the Resident… The
          Government will, in future, hold the rights in land, which the Fulani
          took by conquest from the people, and if Government requires land, it
          will take it for any purpose. The Government will have the rights to
          all minerals, but the people may dig for iron and work it subject to
          the approval of the High Commissioner, and may take salt and other
          minerals subject to any excise imposed by law. Traders will not be
          taxed by chiefs (Sultan or Emir) but only by government. The
          coinage of the British will be accepted as legal tender, and a rate of
          exchange for cowries fixed, in consultation with chiefs, and they will
          enforce it…i</p>
      
          <p>This proclamation outlined clearly the British colonial policies and absolute transfer of power from the Emir of
          Gwandu to the new power led by the High Commissioner and the Resident. Indeed the above statement is
          all-encompassing as what would be the future of colonial Gwandu. What followed was either resistance by those that
          were able to rise against the European usurpers or partial compromise for fear of superior weapons. The European
          invading forces put under their weapons any person or group of persons who dared to defend their sovereignty and
          freedom. Using superior military prowess, the British became the sole
          controller of Gwandu Emirate and it resources.</p>
      
          <p>Since then, going by the provision of the proclamation above mentioned, subsequent Emirs of Gwandu were appointed by
          the colonial government. The letter of appointment and office regulations were enshrined for them to obey. Thus,
          they now became answerable to colonial officers attached to the emirates. That is what marked the turning point in
          the authorities and influence of Gwandu Emirs, who lost the control of their vassal states and forfeited their
          sovereignty to the British. That is also what brought about the emergence of a new political administration known as
          Indirect Rule, a system where colonial officers ruled through the traditional institutions. The Emir and chiefs were
          under direct control of the Resident and District Officer in the Native Administration.</p>
      
          <p>To translate the provision of the Lugard’s proclamation into action, the appointments of the Sultan of Sokoto and
          the Emir of Gwandu in the very year of occupation were test cases. In March 1903, both the offices of the Sultan and
          that of the Emir of Gwandu became vacant. In Sokoto, the British forces had overthrown Caliph Attahiru I for refusal
          to accept the European rule. In Gwandu, Emir Bayero Aliyu died, thereby making it possible for his brother, who was
          also the Dangaladima, Muhammad Aliyu to be sworn in as new emir.</p>
      
          <p>According to Tibendarana, like Muhammad Attahiru of Sokoto, Muhammad Aliyu of Gwandu was given a letter of
          appointment and was made to swear the humiliating oath of allegiance to the English Crown and to obey the commands
          of the High Commissioner and the Resident. Apart from losing similar power as the Sultan of Sokoto, he also lost the
          political influence, which his predecessors had exercised over the western sector of the Caliphate (under the
          control of Gwandu) and other emirates in Niger and Burkina Faso Republics namely, Sayi, Tordi, Konari, Yaga, Birnin
          Ngaure (Birnin-Bayero), Tamkale, Bitinkogi and Liptako.</p>
      
      
          <p>SOME MAJOR CONSEQUENCES OF COLONIAL ADMINISTRATION IN
          GWANDU EMIRATE</p>
      
          The transfer of administrative machinery and control from the hands of emirs to the Europeans was characterised by
          these features:
      
          <p>1. Lost of power and authority by the emirs to colonial administrators (Resident, District Officer, and
          Magistrates). For instance, Emir of Gwandu Muhammad Aliyu was removed out of office in 1906 by the colonial
          government, with no specific offence, but for his refusal to obey them and execute their orders against the need of
          the Emirate, its people and the provisions of the shari’ah. Similarly, in order to show to the Gwandu king-makers
          that, their power to appoint emir in Gwandu was over, the colonial government decided to appoint Sakin Kalgo Haliru
          son of Abdulqadir as new emir after the deposition of Emir Aliyu, against the heir apparent, Dangaladima Basharu,
          son of Sarkin Gwandu Hanafi who reigned from 1875-1876. All these signalled the dangers that will continue to befall
          the institution throughout the colonial administration and beyond.</p>
      
          <p>2. Lost of territorial control: Gwandu Emirate controlled all western parts of the Sokoto Caliphate comprising
          Ilorin, Agaie, Lapai, Nupe, etc were removed away from the control of Gwandu leadership and formed as Ilorin and
          Niger Provinces, under the control of Residents manning the general administration of these areas.</p>
      
          <p>3. Transfer of the emirate capital from Gwandu to Birnin Kebbi, a British plan, which Muhammad Aliyu consistently
          refused to obey.</p>
      
          <p>4. Removal of the emirates Advisory Council, especially the Magajin Gari and other influential councillors so that
          emirs could be dealt decisively by the District Officer and Resident with little or no guidance as usual from his
          closest confidents.</p>
      
          <p>5. Abgrogation of the Shari’ah and institutionalization of English laws. It was noted that, ‘in legislative matters,
          it was stated that the authority to make new laws and to amend the old ones lay with the Governor. This claim of
          legislative powers by Lugard must have been deemed invidious by men who previously had lived by the Shari’ah law and
          had recognized no other legislator but Allah’.</p>
      
          <p>6. Establishment of elementary schools all over Gwandu Division. As far as 1937, there was a central elementary
          school in Birnin Kebbi, and elementary schools of varying levels were also established in Jega, Koko, Kalgo, Bunza,
          Dakin Gari and Ka’oje with enrolment of about four hundred pupils.</p>
      
          <p>7. The Gwandu Emirate assumed a new status of a Division under the Sokoto Province with a very limited authority and
          influence.
